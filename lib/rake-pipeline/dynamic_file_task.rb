    # This class extends Rake's {Rake::FileTask} class to add support
    # for dynamic dependencies. Typically, Rake handles static dependencies,
    # where a file's dependencies are known before the task is invoked.
    # A {DynamicFileTask} also supports dynamic dependencies, meaning the
    # file's dependencies can be determined just before invoking the task.
    # Because calculating a file's dependencies at runtime may be an expensive
    # operation (it could involve reading the file from disk and parsing it
    # to extract dependency information, for example), the results of this
    # calculation are stored on disk in a manifest file, and reused on
    # subsequent runs if possible.
    #
    # For example, consider this file app.c:
    #
    #     #include "app.h"
    #     some_stuff();
    #
    # If we have a task that compiles app.c into app.o, it needs to
    # process app.c to look for additional dependencies specified
    # by the file itself.
